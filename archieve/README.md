# Smart_Cages_2020
Codes related to the study: "Intensive longitudinal characterization of multidimensional biobehavioral dynamics in laboratory rats"


These are old codes for the smart cages. It still uses the server software provided by the company to create the HDF5 files.
Still, it helps to extract parameters from those files. There are a few problems when you want to use the software and create .csv files
The skeletonkey_final.py takes care of those problems and extract whatever info is in the files.
then you can use the extractor and modify it to get other parameters(also the calculated ones such as distance traveled).
And the rest were also some of the codes we use for plots and data polishing for the paper.
